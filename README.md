🍽️ Food Web Project

Welcome to Food, my personal web project inspired by the amazing world of food! This site is currently in development and reflects my vision to create an interactive, visually appealing, and informative experience for food lovers around the globe.

🌐 Overview

The main structure of the website includes:

º Home: A welcoming landing page featuring a large logo, vibrant images, and food-related news. I’m planning to make this page highly visual and engaging.

º Chefs: A section dedicated to the most famous chefs around the world. This page had some technical issues recently, but I’ll be fixing them and adding rich content about each chef.

º Famous Dishes: Here, I’ll showcase iconic dishes from different cultures, each with descriptions and improved visual design.

º Recipes: A collection of typical recipes from around the world, aimed at helping people who love cooking.

º Restaurants: A guide to some of the most renowned restaurants worldwide, with descriptions and details.

The footer is currently under development and will include links similar to those in the header, animations, and additional pages like Privacy Rights and Terms of Service.
